Clean-up changes (DO AFTER RUNNING ON SERVER TO GET DATA):  
- [ ] Change writeFile to log add column cached fitness in both burn in and main model
- [ ] Add the burn in to the main program
- [ ] Save the burn in seed to the top of the burn in output file


## How to run the simulations (Methods)  
Run the shell scripts in numerical order. See the commented first line for usage. Most shell scripts call a SLiM file from `src/sims/`. Some additional SLiM scripts for unused scenarios can be found in `bin/sims/`.
